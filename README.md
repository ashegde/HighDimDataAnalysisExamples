# HighDimDataAnalysisExamples
This folder contains examples from a class I had taken several years ago (~2018) on high-dimensional data analysis.
The material is based on the fantastic texbook: https://book-wright-ma.github.io/. There is a lot of great, foundational knowledge in this book, and I hope to explore extensions of these methods further in the future
